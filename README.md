# Processing Scripts

This is a repository consisting of scripts to process results from listening tests. 

MUSHRA_result_prcoessing script takes the input from a MUSHRA or MUSHRA like test and calculates if there exists any significant differences between the groups. It then plots the results as violin plots and indicates the groups between which significant differences were found via the help of the sigstar function.
